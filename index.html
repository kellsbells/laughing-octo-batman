Nothing seemed totally right and I had ideas of my own I wanted to implement. So I started by deleting lines of code and seeing how it changed the page.

My experience there was mind-blowing. The world of web development totally opened up to me and I fell in love. Each lesson was incredibly fast paced and pretty much a whirlwind, it was amazing.

                                    <p>Towards the end of my time at DevMountain I was actually approached by the team of another local web development bootcamp, <a href="www.isomer.io">Isomer</a>. They needed some additional design and development help and offered to allow me to take the class for free in exchange for my work on various projects. It was a fantastic opportunity to really experiment with my skills. Isomer was a much more selective community and I was able to get lots of one on one with the instructors to broaden and solidify my understanding of more complex development concepts.
